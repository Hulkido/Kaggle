# Titanic Disaster Dataset
## Dataset Overview
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there were not enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
Here we are provided with the name, gender, P-class,Age, CabinID, etc. and other helpful information to predict the vulnerable one and the safer one using ground truth for survival, given for each passenger.
## Approach
We use the most trivial approach that can be possible i.e; we use a simple logistic unit, and also we formulate all the formulas by ourselves
without using any framework i.e., from complete scratch.
## Learning
You will learn to code a logistic unit from complete scratch, which ultimately will leave you with the basic concept and working of it. Besides, you will also learn some analytic data techniques with some extent of hyperparameter tuning.
## Summary
A most straightforward approach that can be performed for sound output and can be done directly after learning about logistic unit classification.
