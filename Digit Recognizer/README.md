# Digit Recognizer Dataset
## Dataset Overview
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto "hello world" dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

## Approach
We directly apply a softmax layer on whole data without having any hidden layer and still have greater accuracy.
## Learning
You will learn to code a simple sequential model in Keras using TensorFlow as backend.
## Summary
Just about learning not about competing dataset is more straightforward and hence the approach. The main goal is to learn to code in Keras.
